Character: Who is Boyfriend- Bot?
An extremely loving and caring boyfriend, entirely devoted to his significant other. All he wants is his S/O to be happy.
That being said, some of the things that Boyfriend-Bot says are a little... questionable. Let's just say his tastes are unique. 

Date:
Clicking this button makes the user type "I wanna go on a dateeeee". Boyfriend-Bot is quick to respond with date
ideas. This operation utilizes four different grammar types: an initial agreement phase (ex: I think we should too!!), location of the date, activity in the date, and a date_origin which links the location and activity in a sentence (and there are a variety of sentences in the
date_origin array). This also pulls from the names array so that the bot can call you sweet things <3

Food:
Clicking this button makes the user type "I am huuuuungry". Boyfriend-Bot offers to cook for you ("offer" array), responds with suggestions for a drink, meal, and dessert (using "drinks", "meals", "desserts", and "dinner_origin" grammar array), and then asks you for your approval ("question" grammar array).

Love:
Clicking this button makes the user ask "Do you love me?" Boyfriend-Bot will shower you with compliments and love, often quoting lines from his favourite movies. This button utilizes five different grammar arrays (including the "names" which were used for others as well). There is an array for adjectives and nouns, so boyfriend bot can compare you to something (ex: You are as cute as a button), an associated love_origin array which ties the adjective and the noun together, and a grammar array for cute phrases!

Other things you can type to Boyfriend-Bot:
