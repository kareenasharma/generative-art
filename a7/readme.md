What is this?
A fish tank! Where each fish can be modified based on the five features described in the "SLIDERS" section below.

SLIDERS:
1. Width : This controls the width or length of the fish. The higher the slider, the longer the fish.
2. Height: This controls the height of the fish. The higher the slider, the taller (vertically) the fish.
3. Hue : This controls the color of the fish. Slide the slider to make your fish any color you want!
4. Roundness : This controls the roundness of the fish. At 0, the fish (and its eyes) are completely square/boxy. At 1, the fish's corners are as round as they can go. 
5. Speed : This controls how fast the fish swims (in a circular motion).
