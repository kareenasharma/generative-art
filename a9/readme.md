DESIGN PROCESS: 
I wanted to challenge myself with this project and pick a theme I was unfamiliar with. I was really inspired by the conversation I had
with Benjamin Kress, a theatre costume design Masters student. Ben talked about the process of designing a costume, which included
searching for inspiration, and thinking not only about how the costume would be aesthetically fitting, but also how it would be functional.
I tried to emulate these steps in my own design process.

First, I searched up inspiration on Pinterest. I had this idea for an "under the sea" theme, which eventually led me to "scary mermaid",
where I found this picture: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/1196337377997875/
There is something so hauntingly beautiful about it, and I decided to use it as my main source of inspiration. My goal was to make a 
sort of mermaid/sea creature which represented aspects of the ocean. 

I started with the eyes, as that is the first thing that stuck out to me in the picture. I wanted to make the centers colored and then
fade them out to black. I did a similar process with the face, where instead the center was black which faded out to color. I wanted to use dark colors and sobre gradients to reflect the darkness and mystery of the deep ocean. 

Then, I moved on to the nose and the mouth. I wanted to use these as pops of color, and so added a neon colored stroke. I like the contrast they make with the subtlety of the eyes and face. They also remind of bioluminescent sea creatures found deep in the ocean.

After this, I moved on to the ears. Here is where I thought about making a costume functional-- I wanted the ears to be like gills which would allow the sea creature to breathe. I modified the code found in the face-rainbar.js to create these pulsating gills. They have a slightly different color than the rest of the face, which I feel gives the sea creature more variety. Behind the ears, I created a headress which I modified from face-angelface.js. I wanted this headress to look like it was made from algae, and was swaying in the wind. Finally, I went on to the hands, which I modified from face-nose.js. I took away the bones and instead just used the joints (which I enlarged). I like how you can still make out the hand structure, but they kind of look like orbs of light, which is another nod to the bioluminescent creatures. 

SLIDERS: 
1. color : This changes the color of the creature (excluding the hands). However, the range of colors is limited to the spectrum between purple/blue and red, to match the deap-sea theme.
2. earSize : This changes the size of the ears, or the gills.
3. featherLength: This changes the length of the feathers on the headress.
4. zoom (created by Kate Compton): This allows you to zoom in on the creature.
