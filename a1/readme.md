Hello! Welcome to my webpage :) 

The corkboard is home to all assignments. Each assignment will be updated on one of the sticky notes.
Transparent buttons will be added to each sticky note with links to each assignmnennt. 
Right now there is just one button on A1, linking to this site! 

Feel free to click on the lamp -- it is a button which can turn on / off dark mode!

Fonts used were Reenie Beenie (for the "notes" text) and 'Courier New', Courier, monospace for the main text.

All images / SVGs were created by me :)
