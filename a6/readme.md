THE SPREAD OF RELIGION

Culture and religion are topics that have always interested me. Additionally, over the years I have come to realize the power
people (especially those close to you) have on each other. This simulations is inspired by the influence of religion / spiritual belief, primarily through word of mouth. It is not created using accurate numbers and therefore is not meant to be a historically accurate simulation, but rather an exploration of the concept.

Reflecting on this assignment, I do feel that it showed the power of influence and it was really cool to see the different rules play out. I think it does show
how quickly ideas can spread (and I think this spread is applicable to concepts beyond religion, suc as gossip).
Going forward, I think it would be very interesting if I used real data to mimic historically accurate phenomena. Right now, this is all
based on fictional numbers (and a limited set of rules).

One main issue I am seeing with this simulation is that it does not take geography into account, which of course can serve as a barrier and hinders the spread.
Going forward, one improvement I would like to make is to model this simulation on an actual map, and the spread would have to be mostly constrained to the land
(and can only travel to other places through special methods like ships / aeroplanes). Another fault is that this only models one religion, so a further improvement would be to model a couple of different religions and observe how they interact with each other.
